an excel clone, inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VYfQc5dq21Vc81G1rGHwkmT

Features/Plans:
- cli version for parsing input files. <- done
- implement small subset of excel functions ( MIN, MAX, AVERAGE...). <- WIP
- very simple gui version with Raylib. <- WIP
- graph ploting (maybe with gnuplot?). <- Maybe
- awk support for scripting (like visual basic in excel). <- Not Sure
